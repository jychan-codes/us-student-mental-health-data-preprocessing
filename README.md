# US Student Mental Health Analysis - Data Preprocessing

This project focuses on preprocessing the US Student Mental Health Data to prepare it for analysis in Tableau. 
The goal is to clean the data, handle missing values, and make it ready for visual analysis and trend/pattern identification. 
The analysis and visualization are performed in Tableau, while the preprocessing steps are done using Python in a Jupyter Notebook.
